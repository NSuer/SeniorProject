## <ins>Professional Biography</ins>

I am a fifth year at the University of Cincinnati, majoring in Computer Science. I have worked at Siemens Digital Industries Software for four co-op rotations in their
Stragetic Student Program. I hope to be hired directly into the services track in the Genesis Program after graduation, I'm currently still in the interview process.

## <ins>Co-op Work Experience</ins> 

*Strategic Student Program | Summer 2022*
- During my first co-op I worked with the **Technical Marketing team**. I was tasked with creating **macros in PowerPoint** that would find or change things that didn't 
match Siemens standards. In the end, I created about 13 macros checking for things like incorrect colors, slide formatting, or properly formatted footers.

*Strategic Student Program | Spring 2023*
- For my second co-op I worked with the Technical Marketing team again but, a different group within it. I was tasked to pull general data from many **AWS** projects 
using **Lambda functions** I would then use **API gateways** to run the Lambda function and automatically upload that data to a **DynamoDB table** Finally, I **created my first ever 
webpage** that would display the data for everyone to see view. *I was informed this project saved the company hundreds of thousands of dollars as they were able to 
view their active month spending on AWS.*

*Strategic Student Program | Fall 2023*
- For my third co-op I worked with the **Advanced Solutions team**. I was tasked with researching and testing different **Large Language Models** (LLM), mostly focusing on 
running Llama 2 locally on work laptops. Using **AWS Bedrock** I was able to interact with and **fine-tune** Llama 2 and AWS Titan. I spent some time working with most of 
the models available (13 at the time). I would ask each model the same set of questions and compare the results to see what each LLM exceled at. Towards the end of 
my co-op I was tasked with creating a webpage using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The webpage allowed the user to talk to their selected LLM using an **API with 
HTTP** requests to talk to the specified model.

*Strategic Student Program | Summer 2024*
- During my fourth and final co-op at Siemens I worked for the Technical Marketing team once again. This co-op my time was split between the Platform and Content team. 
The Platform team assigned me the task of **automating a data transfer process through AWS to Power BI** In AWS, I created a **S3 bucket** that would trigger a Lambda function 
when something was uploaded. The Lambda function would pull the data in the Excel, edit and sort the data, and upload it to a DynamoDB table. The table was then linked 
to **Power BI** to display the data in more detailed ways like charts and graphs with **IAM roles**. The data helped show what Technical Marketing services were being used. 
The Content team tasked me with creating a video about Technical Marketing using online B-Roll footage. I learned how to use **Camtasia**, how **AI** can be used to generate 
a text-to-speech voice over, and how AI can generate subtitles automatically.

## <ins>Project Sought</ins>

My main concern for my capstone project is finding something that I view fun and challenging. However, I don't have anything in mind about a potential project 
unfortunately. I hope to find a group that shares similar interests and has good time management skills. I'd like to start working on our project now so that later on 
we're in a better spot to relax and prepare for our presentation. I'm a very flexible person who's willing to learn new concepts to complete whatever is needed and 
I'd hope for my team to be as well.
