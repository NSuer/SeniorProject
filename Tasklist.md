# Task List

## Nate's tasks
1. Research historic or extant invasive and native species to Ohio.
2. Specify species that will be included in game.
3. Design and implement plant behavior (spread and consumption by animals)
4. Design and implement animal behavior (reproduction and predation mechanics)
5. Test the AI of animals and plants, ensuring they interact with each other and the world properly.

## Kyle's tasks
1. Develop 'looking' actions. (camera pan/zoom, plant/animal/object selection)
2. Implement placeable objects.
3. Design & Test game scaling. How does the user know they are 'winning'?
4. Connect game data to the user interface. (animal/plant/park data presented to the user)
5. Research and test optimization methods to improve game performance.

## Owen's Tasks
1. Research commonly used methods for designing a 3D model, along with past examples.
2. Develop a fully working main menu.
3. Research the different animals and plants for defining features.
4. Design 3D models for different animals and plants, all with the same theme and design.
5. Validate and refine the designs as needed with the team.

## Ryan's Tasks
1. Design a 3D model for each genus of animal and plant, able to be repurposed with scaling.
2. Create a texture map for each species of plant and animal, to apply over their model.
3. Create a rig and a walking, eating, and special animation for each 3D model.
4. Find an existing sound effect or create and record sound effects for environment and animals.
5. Create 3D models for tiles of the game board, covering mountains, plains, lakes, etc.
