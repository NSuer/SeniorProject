## Project Focus
The proposed educational video game focuses on teaching responsible forestry, species management, and invasive species control through an engaging simulation. The game, tentatively named "The Park Department Tycoon," combines elements of animal reserve management with strategic decision-making.

In this isometric 3D game, similar to Zoo Tycoon or RollerCoaster Tycoon, players manage animal populations within a reserve. They must balance the ecosystem by controlling animal and plant populations. An example of this would be controlling deer populations through the introduction of wolves while ensuring the wolves do not decimate the deer population. Players can also manage the reserve to raise funds, conduct expeditions to find and conserve animals, and protect the reserve from poachers.

The game is set in a Ohio-like environment and features challenges related to forestry and animal preservation. Players can send workers on missions, hire staff, and oversee park amenities such as trails and restrooms to generate income. The goal is to create a harmonious enviroment.
