Our project will interact with environmental, social, and economic constraints.
First, our project is closely related to environmental constraints. Because our game is centered on ecosystems and the natural world, the way we portray nature is extremely important. If we do a poor job depicting wildlife, our users may interact with the real natural world in inappropriate ways.
Second, our project definitely interacts with social constraints. Our project aims to familiarize people with their environments and to encourage them to be more involved outside. If we are successful in getting people outside and excited to learn about their local wildlife, we are certainly enhancing people's lives.
Lastly, our project has some overlap with economic constraints. We would love to make our game free, so that it is as accessible as possible. Ultimately, though, if we were to continue development on our game, we would need financial compensation to offset the time we could have spent working a paid job. For that reason, we would likely have to make our game a low cost video game. Another potential avenue would be seeking funding from organizations that promote environmental education, or even crowd sourcing our product.
