Individual Capstone Project

Our group has decided to develop a video game that we, as four people who play video 
games, believe is a new fun concept. We’ve decided to make an animal sanctuary/park 
management game. The goal is to teach the user more about taking care of animals and learning 
more about the natural ecosystem. The user must take care of different animals native to Ohio, 
but they have to take the necessary precautions to keep out dangerous predators. The user can 
make money, possibly from opening their park to the public, to purchase upgrades to protect 
their animals, buy food, or park building upgrades. We also currently have a concept where the 
user unlocks each animal by doing a mission that teaches you about the animal and their predator 
and tasks you with capturing it or luring it back to your park. There are more factors we’ve 
discussed, like weather, biomes, and the player's point of view, for which we currently plan on 
doing an isometric view.

As fifth-year Computer Science majors, we have all received the necessary skills and 
training to complete this task. Unfortunately, I cannot say we have a class to directly relate to 
video game creation, but we have been taught a lot of important and commonly used aspects. We 
learned about using classes way back during our second year at UC during CS 2028C, Data 
Structures, and we somewhat have an idea how sprites work because of CS 4033, AI Principles 
and Applications. We can also use our knowledge about running a project from start to finish we 
received from EECE 3093C, Software Engineering. After some research and from a group 
member's recommendation, we’ve decided to build our app using Godot, which has its own 
script language. Godot is very similar to Python, which we have been using and learning about 
since freshman year in ENED 1100 and ENED 1120. I believe that we have been taught the 
necessary requirements to create a video game at this level of complexity while keeping it 
informative and fun for the user.

All four of my co-op rotations were at Siemens Digital Industries Software, working with 
the Technical Marketing and Advanced Solutions teams. Technical Marketing has given me a lot 
of different experiences using the different software that the company commonly utilizes, 
including AWS. My work in AWS, or Amazon Web Services, has been primarily focused on 
programming automated processes in Lambda using Python. I’ve learned how to create a 
naturally flowing program that can call upon its different sequences and triggers to get the 
desired result. Each co-op I standardly receive one large project that’s expected to take most of 
the co-op and several small projects. This has shown me how to balance my time between 
projects and how to be as productive as possible. There will be many different roles, each with its 
own list of tasks that we will have to complete in a timely and effective manner.

My primary goal for a senior design project was to find something I found fun but 
challenging and creative. Video games have been a part of my life since I was very young. I grew 
up with a Wii and Nintendo DS to provide entertainment whenever I wasn’t outside playing with 
my neighbors. It’s one of the reasons why I decided to become a Computer Science major and 
programmer, to understand and learn more about how these games were created. Unfortunately, I 
never got around to making my own game other than one in high school, which was a very awful 
version of the retro game “Centipede” that was programmed in QBASIC. This project will give 
me a chance to create a complex game using the different aspects I have been using in the video 
games I have played for decades. Similar to this game, every co-op I’m tasked with 
programming in a new software and coding language, which causes me some trouble, but I’m 
always able to research and properly prepare. I will be using the same techniques when 
programming our video game.

I was assigned the primary role of frontend developer along with Ryan Williams. As a 
very basic description, we are “in charge of how we interact with the game, 3D models, and 
animations. Basically, anything visual.”. During my past classes like Software Engineering and 
during my co-ops, I’ve created and learned a lot about designing an easy and efficient UI, and I 
hope to use that knowledge during our project. If I can successfully create and design all of the 
different 3D animals, buildings, animal pens, etc., I will be more than happy with my 
accomplishments. All members were also given the role of core gameplay manager to ensure all 
members can convey their thoughts and opinions about updates to the game. If we as a team can 
successfully make an informative and fun game that could be uploaded to a commonly used 
game installation software like Steam, we will all be more than happy with our accomplishments. 
The game is still a very rough idea, but using our collective knowledge, I know we will be able 
to create the amazing game we’re all imagining.
