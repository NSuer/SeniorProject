# Planned Milestones
1. Set up development environment
* Install Godot on all developer machines, start a Github repository, establish style guide.
2. Research animals/plants of Ohio, set list of species for the game.
3. Set up main menus
4. Design, implement core game view, controls
5. Implement game terrain
6. Implement animal and plant behavior
7. Implement placeable objects
8. Design, import animal, plant models
* Starting in tandem with milestones 2 onwards. Each genus of animal and plant will have a unique model, and species that look similar can share a model resized or scaled. 
9. Paint, apply textures for models
* Each species will have its own texture, giving lifelike variety to the game. Male and female variations may be added depending on whether they're different enough to justify.
10. Implement rigs for animal models, play animations
* Each model will have a model rig / rudimentary skeleton that can play a walk cycle, eating, and special animation.Animations will likely be reused to save time.
11. Implement sound design
12. Implement scenario packs
* Special starting conditions or edits to simulation rules to give unique challenges not seen in the core game mode. Can be cut if necessary to grow the core game more.
