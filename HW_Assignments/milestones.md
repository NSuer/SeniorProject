# Planned Milestones
1. Set up development environment
* Install Godot on all developer machines, start a Github repository, establish style guide.
2. Research animals/plants of Ohio, set list of species for the game.
3. Set up main menus, the main menu will allow the user to start or end the game along with adjusting their settings.
4. Design, implement core game view, controls
5. Implement game terrain, general grass field and trees representing the playable area. Different animals will have their own habitat and plants may have different plots.
6. Implement animal and plant behavior, some if not all of the animals can have their own animation(s) of common action(s).
7. Implement placeable objects, the different habitats and plant plots can be placed down into the game terrain.
8. Design, import animal, plant models
* Starting in tandem with milestones 2 onwards. Each genus of animal and plant will have a unique model, and species that look similar can share a model resized or scaled. 
9. Paint, apply textures for models
* Each species will have its own texture, giving lifelike variety to the game. Male and female variations may be added depending on whether they're different enough to justify.
10. Implement rigs for animal models, play animations
* Each model will have a model rig / rudimentary skeleton that can play a walk cycle, eating, and special animation.Animations will likely be reused to save time.
11. Implement sound design, some if not all of the animals will need it's own corresponding sound. There will also be a nature esque sound as a background noise.
12. Implement scenario packs, we plan in to include different scenarios the user needs to prepare for like a storm or heat wave.
* Special starting conditions or edits to simulation rules to give unique challenges not seen in the core game mode. Can be cut if necessary to grow the core game more.
