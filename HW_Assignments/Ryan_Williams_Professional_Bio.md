## Professional Biography

I am a strong developer and communicator, backed up with co-op rotations in the USA and Germany.

For the first three rotations of my co-op career, I worked with the Technology and Innovation department at Siemens Digital Industries in Milford. During my time with this role, I worked with a large variety of technologies and fields of study. Java was a common focus, both with Google Glass app developent, as wll as inhouse tool development. I took several projects related to mixed reality, including the research and documentation of 3D modelling and scenes in the browser, and artificial intelligence models across frameworks. 

For the final two rotations of co-op with my university, I went abroad to work with Siemens Healthineers in Bavaria, Germany. The majority of my work here was in data analytics, making sense out of sales data and drawing key insights to the preferences of customers. I also worked extensively with automation, using Power Automate to eliminate human error and unneccessary time from common tasks done on a regular basis.
