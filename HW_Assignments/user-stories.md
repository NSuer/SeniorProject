As an Ohio resident, I want an application that allows me to interact with ecology, so that I may better understand my local environment.

As a History enthusiast, I want to play through historical environmental situations, as a way to better immerse myself in the content and to see how the situations were handled properly.

As a Forest/Park worker, I want the invasive species & endangered species of Ohio (like Honey Suckle, Privet, and Burning Bush) to represented so that more people know what we are working to remove and what we are trying to protect.

As a gamer, I would like an entertaining game that shows me a new perspective on the ecology around me and how I can interact with it.

As a teacher, I want a way to present information about ecology in an interesting way, so that my students will be more enthusiastic to learn.
