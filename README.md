TODO Remove this
Hi eveyone, I'm not sure if y'all remeber me saying this but I'll be gone for this weeks meeting because I am going out of town for my brothers wedding and can't do HW. I marked areas with nothing in the with 'TODO'.  They expect that all assignments will be atleast minorly updated since our original submission. I made the table of contents and Linked most of our assignments. I hope that this helps you all and I'm sorry I can't be there with y'all to do the rest of the work.
